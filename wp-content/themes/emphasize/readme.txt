    Emphasize
-------------------------------------------------------

Emphasize offers a clean design concept, so much that even my main website is using it! Simple to use with many features to give you better flexibility, customizability, stability, and other things like being mobile responsive, several blog styles, page templates, unlimited colours using the built-in WordPress Customizer, post formats, social networking, Schema microdata (structured data) for Google, and more more...

Requires at least WordPress version 4 for the best experience.

* How do I change Styles or Modify the Theme?

You have a couple options available, but 

1. Making "only" stylesheet (CSS) changes, you can use a plugin for editing CSS
2. To make CSS and/or modify the theme files, it's recommended to use a child theme so that you can keep your original theme up to date without losing your modifications/changes.
